# odin-project-landing-page-project
This is a basic implementation of HTML,CSS and Flexbox. Its a basic project and I have not implemented Grid, responsive design, semantic html or any CSS framework.
I have implemented a site with divs, used class,id and child selectors in order to individually target certain elements and make some sytling to it.
I have also used Flexbox to position my elements to where i wanted them to be.
